My Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio website — a digital space where I showcase my skills, projects, and passion for building with code. Designed to be both visually engaging and technically sound, this portfolio reflects my journey as a developer and highlights the work I'm most proud of.

The site includes an overview of my background, featured projects with live demos and source code links, and ways to get in touch. Each section is crafted to communicate not just what I build, but how I approach problem-solving, design, and development.

The portfolio is built using modern web technologies including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React. It is fully responsive, optimized for all devices, and focused on clean UI/UX to ensure visitors have a seamless experience navigating through my work.

This project also served as a personal sandbox for experimenting with animations, layout design, and frontend best practices. Beyond showcasing my work, it’s a platform where I continue to iterate, learn, and grow as a developer.

Feel free to explore, check out my projects, and connect with me if you'd like to collaborate, provide feedback, or just say hi.
